1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

Introduction:

1.HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol
*It is a method that the computers and servers use to request and send information

(Eg: when we search cricbuzz.com on a browser,

2.the browser sends an HTTP request to the respective server
3.then the server sends HTTP response 
4.finally the browser changes the response to a understandable format for the users
5.This is process is done by DNS)
6.HTTP was created in 1997 and developed 
7.It is called as HTTP 1.1
8.A new version of HTTP was called HTTP 2 in 2015.

Difference between:

1.HTTP 2 is much faster and more efficient than the HTTP 1.1.
2.It is because of how it prioritizes content during the loading process
3.HTTP 1.1 uses more tcp connections than the HTTP 2 .

For example,
-> (*HTTP 1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
   HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource)
-> Even though HTTP 2 is more faster and efficient than the older version HTTP 1.1
