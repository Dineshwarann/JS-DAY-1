2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

1.Objects are important in javascript.
2.Objects are different than primitive datatypes.
3.Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key & value pair. 
4.These keys can be variables or functions and methods.

Internal Representation:

1.Window.document
2.Document gets loaded into Window Object

examples of How we can use,

var details = new Object(); //this will create a new object

details.name = "Dinesh";

details.age = 22;

details.gender = "male";

Can be accessed by,

dot method:
console.log(details.name)//output:Dinesh
map method:
console.log(details[name])//output:Dinesh
